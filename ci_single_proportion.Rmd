## R

The `prop_test` function in the *catfun* package provides both approximated confidence intervals and exact confidence intervals for single proportions. For more information run `?prop_test` in the R console. Another possible function is `BinomCI()` in the *DescTools* package.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(catfun)

prop_test(2, 6, method = "wald", conf.level = .95)
```

## SAS

To create confidence intervals for a single proportion in SAS use the frequency procedure. 

The syntax is: 

```{}
proc freq data = <dataset>; 
  table <variable name> / binomial(p = <null value>) alpha = <alpha level>; 
  weight <weighting variable if summary data>; 
run; 
```

The following example tests if the proportion 0.33 (2/6) is equal to 0.5 in the population. Because this is summary level data, we include a weight statement and indicate that the variable loss contains the counts. 

```{r, engine = "sas", engine.path = "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"}
data followup1; 
  input loss; 
  cards; 
  2
  4
  ;
run; 

title 'Loss to Follow-up Exact CI Example'; 
proc freq data = followup1 order = data; 
  table loss / binomial(p = 0.5) alpha = 0.05; 
  weight loss; 
run; 
```
